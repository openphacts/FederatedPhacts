# FederatedPhacts

This repo explores lightweight ways of integrating distributed data from the variety of life science infrastructures already available from a variety of organizations. 

There are two key approaches:
* Using Federated SPARQL queries
* Exposing encapuslated sparql queries as web apis through [grlc.io](http://grlc.io). 

Both APIs and SPARQL queries can be combined using juypter notebooks. Examples of test cases can be found here:
